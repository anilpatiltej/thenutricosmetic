                        To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the UK and/or European Economic Area (EEA), eg:
                        <br><br>
                        • with our offices or other companies within our group located outside the UK/EEA;
                        <br><br>
                        • with your and our service providers located outside the UK/EEA;
                        <br><br>
                        • if you are based outside the UK/EEA;
                        <br><br>
                        • where there is an international dimension to the services we are providing to you.
                        <br><br>
                        These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK data protection law. This means we can only transfer your personal information to a country or international organisation outside the UK/EEA where:
                        <br><br>
                        • the European Commission has issued an ‘adequacy decision’ in relation to that country or international organisation; or
                        <br><br>
                        • there are appropriate safeguards in place, together with enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects; or
                        <br><br>
                        • a specific exception applies under data protection law
                        <br><br>
                        These are explained below
                        <br><br>

                    <p>
                        The European Commission has the power to determine whether a country or international organisation provides an adequate level of protection for personal information and, if it does, to issue an ‘adequacy decision’. The effect of such a decision is that personal information can flow from the UK/EEA to that country without any further safeguards being necessary.
                        <br><br>
                        It can take several years for the European Commission to issue an adequacy decision and only a small number of countries currently benefit from one.

                        We may transfer your data to a third country or international organisation on this ground where we are satisfied the transfer complies with data protection law, appropriate safeguards are in place, and enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects.
                        <br><br>
                        The safeguards will usually include using standard data protection contract clauses approved by the European Commission.

                        In the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, we may transfer personal information to a third country or international organisation where an exception applies under relevant data protection law, eg:
                        <br><br>
                        • you have explicitly consented to the proposed transfer after having been informed of the possible risks;
                        <br><br>
                        • the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between us or to take pre-contract measures at your request;
                        <br><br>
                        • the transfer is necessary for a contract in your interests, between us and another person; or
                        <br><br>
                        • the transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                        <br><br>
                        We may also transfer information for the purpose of our compelling legitimate interests, so long as those interests are not overridden by your interests, rights and freedoms. Specific conditions apply to such transfers and we will provide relevant information if and when we seek to transfer your personal information on this ground.
