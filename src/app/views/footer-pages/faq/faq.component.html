                    <p>
                        It's down to our unique business model. At The Nutricosmetic Company, you are shopping pieces
                        from our brands and partners worldwide,
                        expertly curated for you by our team. Prices are determined by each partner, so the price of the
                        same item may vary depending on where
                        it's coming from and your location.
                        That's also why placing an item in your shopping bag or Wishlist won't reserve it at a
                        particular price.
                        <br><br>
                        Although we don’t have any control over price variation, we will always offer you the best price
                        available to your destination at the time of purchase.
                        To view the most accurate prices, select your delivery destination at the top left corner of our
                        site.

                        completing your purchase. If your local currency is unavailable,
                        your order will be charged in GBP for a competitive exchange rate.

                        taken once your order is ready for shipping, but your bank or card issuer may reserve the order
                        amount in your account immediately.

                        The Nutricosmetic Company ships to the following destinations on a DDP (Delivery Duties Paid)
                        basis:
                        <br><br>
                        European Union, The United Kingdom, USA, Canada, China Mainland, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto

                        Switzerland, Singapore, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, India, Lebanon, Norway, Saudi
                        Arabia,
                        Taiwan Region, Thailand, U.A.E, Japan, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Spain - Canary
                        Islands,
                        Hong Kong SAR, Egypt, Isle of Man and San Marino.
                        <br><br>
                        This means that all applicable taxes and duties are included in the final purchase price when
                        you
                        place your order and there are no additional costs due upon delivery.
                        <br><br>
                        If a DAP (Delivery At Place) destination is selected, the price you pay to The Nutricosmetic
                        Company will exclude all
                        relevant import duties and sales taxes. As the recipient, you'll need to instead pay these
                        directly to
                        our carrier to release your order from customs upon arrival.
                        <br><br>
                        For US customers, The Nutricosmetic Company does not collect sales or use tax in all states.
                        Your purchase may be subject to sales or use tax, unless your state is exempt from taxation.
                        Many states require a sales/use tax return filing at the end of the year for taxable purchases
                        that were not taxed (including internet purchases) and payment of use tax on those purchases.
                        <br><br>

                        While The Nutricosmetic Company ships internationally, the brands on our site can
                        determine where their products are distributed — so some may not be available to purchase in all
                        regions.
                        A selection of the products on our site may also be restricted by local customs in the country
                        you are shipping to.

                        Simply follow these steps to prepare your item:
                        <br><br>
                        Place any unwanted items with original packaging inside the original box and leave it open until
                        the driver has checked the contents.
                        <br><br>
                        Attach the return label and a signed copy of the return note to the outside of the box. Please
                        do not attach any labels to an item’s branded box.
                        <br><br>
                        If you are returning to multiple locations, please pack the items separately for each of our
                        partners, with a corresponding return label attached to the outside of each box.

                        Refunds are issued via the original payment method and will normally appear within 10 business
                        days, depending on the processing time of your payment provider.

                        You can follow the progress of your package with our courier using the tracking number assigned
                        to your returns label. As soon as it's and accepted by our partner we will send an email to
                        confirm your refund.
                        <br><br>
                        To ensure your refund is as quick as possible, it needs to meet the conditions of our <a
                        [routerLink]="['/returns-exchanges']" target="_blank">Returns & Refunds Policy.</a>

                        While we offer returns for all orders, the original delivery cost won’t be included in your
                        refund.
                        If you have shipped an order to a DAP (Delivery At Place) destination, taxes and duties are
                        non-refundable through The Nutricosmetic Company.
                        You may be able to recover these by contacting your local customs office directly. If you have
                        shipped an order to a DDP (Delivery Duties Paid) destination, taxes and duties are refundable
                        through The Nutricosmetic Company.
